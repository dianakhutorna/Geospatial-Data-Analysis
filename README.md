# Final assignment

**Deadline:** 30.01.2024, 23:59 CET

## Guidelines

- All the information regarding the datasets, the tasks to complete and the grading is described in the "Final Assignment Description" file in WueCampus.
- Include all your code and documentation in the "final_assignment.ipynb" notebook (hereafter "the notebook"). Use markdown to add documentation and interpretation of your results (you may want to review Assignment1 to do this in a proper way).
- Recall that we're not going to re-run your code, thus everything you want to include must be in the output of the code chunks of the notebook.
- Submission follows the same rules as the previous assignments. The notebook will be the only file reviewed (and graded) thus make sure that everything is included there.
- (In "requirements.txt") we already include the packages that you'll need to finish the assignment. If you think you need any other, feel free to install it.   
- We suggest you include all the data under the "data" directory and then read it into the notebook with the "os.path.join" function (same as the previous assignments) to maintain the structure of the repo.
